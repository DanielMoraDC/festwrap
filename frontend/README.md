# Overview

This component implements a web application that we can use to retrieve Spotify Access tokens, so we can use them in the backend.

In the future, we want this to be an interface to enable and customize playlist creations for the user.

# Devleopment setup

Make sure Node 10.5.0+ and Make are available in your system. Then install dependencoes:

```shell
npm install
```

To run this app you need to create your own Spotify app following [these instructions](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started#create-an-app).

Then fill the env file (i.e. `.env`) with the corresponding Spotify secrets:

```text
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<spotify_client_id>
SPOTIFY_SECRET=<spotify_secret>
REDIRECT_URI=<redirect_uri>
```

To run the app, type:

```shell
make run-app
```
